### `--max-stack-size` vs `--max_old_space_size` in Node.js v8

#### `--max-stack-size`

- **Purpose**: `--max-stack-size` is used to specify the maximum stack size for the V8 engine's stack space.
- **Stack Size**: This flag sets the maximum size of the call stack, which is the space allocated for function call frames. When a function is called, its arguments and local variables are stored in the stack frame. A large call stack size allows for deep recursion.
- **Usage**: You can specify the stack size in kilobytes using this flag. For example, `--max-stack-size=4096` sets the stack size to 4MB.
- **When to Use**: Increase the stack size if your application uses deep recursion or if you encounter stack overflow errors.

#### `--max_old_space_size`

- **Purpose**: `--max_old_space_size` is used to specify the maximum heap size for the V8 engine's old generation memory.
- **Heap Size**: This flag sets the maximum size of the heap memory where long-lived objects are stored. It affects the overall memory consumption of your Node.js application.
- **Usage**: You can specify the heap size in megabytes using this flag. For example, `--max_old_space_size=2048` sets the heap size to 2GB.
- **When to Use**: Increase the heap size if your application is memory-intensive and you encounter out-of-memory errors. This is particularly useful for applications that process large amounts of data or maintain large data structures.

Both flags are useful for optimizing the memory usage and performance of Node.js applications, but they serve different purposes and affect different aspects of memory management within the V8 engine.
