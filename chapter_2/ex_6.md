## Execution Phases of the Node Event Loop

In Node.js, the event loop consists of multiple phases, each responsible for handling different types of tasks. While the event loop itself is indeed a loop where tasks are continuously processed, the concept of phases helps to organize and prioritize tasks within each iteration of the loop.

The event loop in Node.js typically consists of the following phases:

- Timers:
  This phase handles the execution of callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval(). The event loop checks if any timers have expired, and if so, it executes their associated callback functions.

- I/O Callbacks:
  In this phase, the event loop executes I/O-related callback functions, such as those registered with setImmediate() and callbacks for network I/O operations like file system operations, TCP socket operations, and other asynchronous tasks.

- Idle, Prepare:
  These phases are internal and generally not directly exposed to developers. They are used for internal bookkeeping and preparation tasks related to the event loop.

- Poll:
  The poll phase is responsible for retrieving new I/O events from the event queue. If there are no pending I/O events, the event loop may wait for events to arrive (blocking) or execute certain system-dependent operations.

- Check:
  The check phase executes callbacks registered with setImmediate(). This phase occurs after the poll phase if there are no timers scheduled or pending I/O events to process.

- Close Callbacks:
  The close callbacks phase executes callbacks related to close events, such as socket.on('close', ...) or server.on('close', ...). This phase allows cleanup tasks to be performed after closing resources.

## Difference between setImmediate callback execution within the I/O callback phase and the Check phase

The distinction between the I/O callback phase and the check phase in Node.js can be subtle, especially since both phases execute callbacks scheduled with setImmediate(). However, the difference lies in their timing and priorities within the event loop:

- I/O Callback Phase:
  The I/O callback phase executes callbacks that are related to I/O events, such as file system operations, network operations, and other asynchronous tasks. These callbacks are typically scheduled by the completion of asynchronous I/O operations, including callbacks registered with setImmediate() within those I/O event handlers.
  The I/O callback phase occurs after the execution of I/O-related operations in the event loop, such as handling TCP sockets, reading/writing files, or processing DNS requests. It ensures that I/O-related callbacks are processed after their associated I/O operations have completed.

- Check Phase:
  The check phase executes callbacks that are scheduled explicitly using setImmediate(). These callbacks are typically intended to be executed at the earliest opportunity after the current event loop iteration, without waiting for I/O operations to complete.
  The check phase occurs after the poll phase in the event loop. If there are no timers scheduled or pending I/O events to process, the event loop enters the check phase and executes the callbacks scheduled with setImmediate().
  The check phase is often used for tasks that need to be executed immediately after the current event loop iteration, regardless of the completion of I/O operations.
